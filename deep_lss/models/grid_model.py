        Args:
            network (Union[list, tf.keras.Sequential]): The underlying network of the model. Can be a list of layers,
                then either a regular tf.keras.Sequential or HealpyGCNN model is initialized.
            n_side (int): The healpy n_side of the input.
            indices (np.ndarray): 1d array of indices, corresponding to the pixel ids of the input map footprint.
            n_neighbors (int, optional): Number of neighbors considered when building the graph, currently supported
                values are: 8, 20, 40 and 60. Defaults to 20.
            max_batch_size (int, optional): Maximal batch size this network is supposed to handle. This determines the
                number of splits in the tf.sparse.sparse_dense_matmul operation, which are subsequently applied
                independent of the actual batch size. Defaults to None, then no such precautions are taken, which may
                cause an error.
            initial_Fin (int, optional) Initial number of input features. Defaults to None, then like for
                max_batch_size, there are no precautions taken.
            input_shape (tf.tensor, optional): Input shape of the network, necessary if one wants to restore the model.
                Defaults to None.

                Adam.

            summary_dir (str, optional): Directory to save the summaries. Defaults to None.
            checkpoint_dir (str, optional): Directory where to save the weights and optimizer. Defaults to None.
            restore_checkpoint (bool, optional): Whether to restore the network from a checkpoint, or initialize it.
                Defaults to False.
            max_checkpoints (int, optional): Maximum number of checkpoints to keep. Defaults to 3.
            init_step (int, optional): Initial step. Defaults to 0.
            z_bank_size (int, optional): Size of the memory bank for the z regularization. Defaults to None, then no
                memory bank is used.
            strategy (Union[tf.distribute.Strategy, deep_lss.utils.distribute.HorovodStrategy], optional):
                The distribution strategy the model was created within. Defaults to None, then training is local.
            xla (bool, optional): Whether to enable XLA just in time compilation. Note that this is incompatible with
                the DeepSphere graph convolutional layers, as they contain unsupported
                SparseDenseMatirxMultiplications. Defaults to False.
            summary_every (int, optional): Write TensorBoard summaries every N training steps. Defaults to 1.

                ``grid_train_step`` requires the ``i_sobol`` and ``i_signal`` index tensors as additional
                inputs, and the memory bank (``z_bank_size``) must be disabled. Defaults to None.
            z_type (str, optional): Type of regularization for z features. One of ``"vicreg"``, ``"mmd"``,
