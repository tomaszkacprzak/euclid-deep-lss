        Args:
            out_features (int, optional): Output shape of the regression head. This determines the size of the learned
                summary statistics. Defaults to 6.
            base_channels (int, optional): Number of channels after the first layer of the network. This number gets
                multiplied by a factor of two for every downsampling layer. Defaults to 32.
            downsampling_layers (int, optional): Number of pseudoconvolutions to perform a downsampling of the
                neighboring Healpix pixels. Note that these layers are fairly cheap and their number effectively
                determines how expensive the following (residual) graph convolutions are. Defaults to 3.
            cheby_layers (int, optional): Number of Chebyshev convolutions to downsample with. These layers play the
                same role as the pure downsampling layers, just include an additional (Chebyshev) graph convoution.
                Defaults to 2.
            residual_layers (int, optional): Number of residual layers. These are the main graph convolutions. Defaults
                to 6.
            head_type (str, optional): Type of regression head to be used, allowed are "dense" and "conv. Defaults to
                "dense".
            dropout_rate (float, optional): Dropout rate within the regression head. Defaults to None, then it's not
                included.
            poly_degree (int, optional): Degree of the polynomials within the Chebyshev convolutions. Defaults to 5.
            norm_kwargs (dict, optional): Keyword arguments to be passed to the normalization layers. Defaults to {}.
            activation (callable, optional): Non-linear activation function to be used throughout. Defaults to
                tf.nn.relu.
            smoothing_kwargs (dict, optional): Keyword arguments to be passed to the smoothing layer. Defaults to None,
                then no smoothing is performed within the network.
