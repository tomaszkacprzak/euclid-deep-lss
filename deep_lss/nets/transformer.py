            out_features (int, optional): Output shape of the regression head. This determines the size of the learned
                summary statistics. Defaults to 6.
            hidden_dim (int, optional): The dimension of the key, value, and query space within the standard multi-head
                transformer layers. Defaults to 128.
            healpix_patch_fac (int, optional): The downsampling factor for the Healpix data. The n_side is halved for
                every downsampling, controlling the size of the patches. Larger values mean more and smaller patches,
                which is generally less computationally expensive since the cost of the attention layers is quadratic
                in the patch size. Defaults to 4, then n_side=512 -> n_side=32, such that each ViT patch is made up of
                all of the n_side=512 subpixels within a n_side=32 superpixel.
            attention_heads (int, optional): The number of attention heads. Defaults to 4.
            transformer_layers (int, optional): The number of standard multi-head transformer blocks. Defaults to 4.
            pos_encoding (bool, optional): Whether to add positional encoding. Defaults to True.
            layer_norm (bool, optional): Whether to use layer normalization. Defaults to True.
            second_to_last_features (int, optional): Number of features in the second to last layer of the regression.
                Defaults to None, then no dense second to last layer is included.
            dropout_rate (float, optional): Dropout rate within the regression head. Defaults to None, then it's not
                included.
            activation (callable, optional): Non-linear activation function to be used throughout. Defaults to
                tf.nn.relu.
            smoothing_kwargs (dict, optional): Keyword arguments to be passed to the smoothing layer. Defaults to None,
