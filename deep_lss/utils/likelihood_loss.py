Fully supervised loss functions that take a label. The likelihood loss is based off 
https://github.com/tomaszkacprzak/deep_lss/blob/main/deep_lss/networks/losses.py
by Tomasz Kacprzak (itself based off Janis Fluri's implementation).

    """Calculate the negative likelihood loss like in equation (17) in https://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.03156.pdf.

    Args:
        predictions (tf.Tensor): Predictions of the network. The first n_theta values predict the parameter mean and
            the rest is used to build the covariance matrix via the Cholesky decomposition.
        theta_true (tf.Tensor): True parameter values.
        n_theta (int): Number of parameters. This is used to infer the number of predicted matrix elements in the
            Cholesky decomposition.
        lambda_tikhonov (Union[float, tf.Variable], optional): Regularization parameter for the Tikhonov
            regularization. This penalizes predicting the zero matrix as the covariance. When this is a tf.Variable,
            the regularization strength can be varied with a scheduler. It is recommended that tikhonov regularization
            is only applied at the beginning of training, since the two terms of the likelihood loss is constructed to
            balance its two terms and the regularization can skew results. Note that this has been implemented because
            we have observed network training to get stuck close to the zero matrix. Defaults to None, then no
            regularization is applied.
        eps (float, optional): Small value to ensure that the determinant is not zero, which would be a problem for the
            logarithm. Defaults to 1e-30.
        training (bool, optional): Whether the loss is used for training. If False, no summaries will be written even
            if a summary_writer is supplied. Defaults to True.
        summary_writer (tf.summary.SummaryWriter, optional): The writer used to write tensorboard summaries. Defaults
            to None.
        img_summary (bool, optional): Whether to write image summaries of the covariance matrix. Defaults to False.
        xla (bool, optional): Whether to enable XLA just in time compilation. Note that this is incompatible with
            the DeepSphere graph convolutional layers, as they contain unsupported
            SparseDenseMatirxMultiplications. Defaults to False.

    Returns:
        tf.Tensor: Mean loss value over the batch.
