            * The fourth part was generated with parameters where off_sets[1] was subtracted from the second param
            * and so on

    Args:
        predictions (tf.tensor): The predictions a.k.a. summary statistics in the specified ordering.
        n_params (int): Number of underlying (cosmological) model parameters.
        n_same (int): Number of (uperturbed) summaries coming from the same parameter set, this is the same as the
            (local) batch size
        off_sets (np.ndarray): The off-sets used to perturb the original (fiducial) parameters. These are used as the
            finite differences in the computation of the Jacobian.
        force_params_value (float, np.ndarray, optional): Either None or a set of parameters with shape
            (n_points, 1, n_output) which is used to compute a square loss of the unperturbed summaries. It is useful
            to set this for example to zeros such that the network does not produces arbitrary high summary values.
            Defaults to None, float inputs are broadcast to the appropriate shape.
        force_params_weight (float, optional): The weight of the square loss of force_params_value. Defaults to 1.0.
        jac_weight (float, optional): The weight of the Jacobian loss, which forces the Jacobian of the summaries
            to be close to unity (or identity matrix). Defaults to 100.0.
        cov_loss (bool, optional): If true, the jac_weight will be used as cov_weight, i.e. loss cov mat will be
            forced to be close to the identity matrix. Note that there will be an additional term forcing the inverse
            of the covariance to be close to the identity as well since the cov is guaranteed to be square. This is the
            same as Luca's regularization term, but without the adaptive weight. Defaults to False.
        jac_cond_weight (float, optional): If not None, this weight is used to add an additional loss using the matrix
            condition number of the jacobian. Defaults to None.
        n_output (int, optional): Dimensionality of the summary statistic. Defaults to None, which corresponds to
            predictions.shape[-1].
        n_partial (np.ndarray, optional): To train only on a subset of parameters and not all underlying model
            parameter. Defaults to None which means the information inequality is minimized in a normal fashion. Note
            that due to the necessity of some algebraic manipulations n_partial == None and n_partial == n_params lead
            to slightly different behaviour. Defaults to None.
        weights (np.ndarray, optional): An 1d array of length n_points, used as weights in means of the different
            points. Defaults to None.
        no_correlations (bool, optional): Do not consider correlations between the parameter, this means that one tries
            to find an optimal summary (single value) for each underlying model parameter, only possible if
            n_output == n_params. Defaults to False.
        use_log_det (bool, optional): Use the log of the determinants in the information inequality, should be True. If
            False the information inequality is not minimized in a proper manner and the training can become unstable.
            Defaults to True.
        tikhonov_regu (bool, optional): Use Tikhonov regularization of matrices e.g. to avoid vanishing determinants.
            This is the recommended regularization method as it allows the usage of some optimized routines. Defaults
            to False.
        eps (float, optional): A small positive value used for regularization of things like logs etc. This should
            only be increased if tikhonov_regu is used and a error is raised. Defaults to 1e-32.
        summary_writer (tf.summary.SummaryWriter, optional): The writer used to write tensorboard summaries. Defaults
            to None.
        training (bool, optional): Whether the loss is used for training. If False, no summaries will be written even
            if a summary_writer is supplied. Defaults to True.
        img_summary (bool, optional): Save image summaries of the Jacobian and the covariance. Defaults to False.
        print_scalar (bool, optional): Print the scalar value of the loss to the console. Defaults to False.
        summary_suffix (str, optional): A label used to identify the summaries in tensorboard. Defaults to "".
        strategy (tf.distribute.Strategy): The distribution strategy the model was created within

    Raises:
        ValueError: When there are specifications that conflict with the no_correlations boolean.

    Returns:
        tf.tensor: The loss value, which can be negative.
